## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

```shell
helm repo add vega https://vegaprotocol.github.io/helm-charts
```

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.  You can then run `helm search repo
vega` to see the charts.

To install the <chart-name> chart:

```shell
helm install my-<chart-name> vega/<chart-name>
```

To uninstall the chart:

```shell
helm delete my-<chart-name>
```
